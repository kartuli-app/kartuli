# Kartuli - Georgian Language Learning Platform

## Project Overview

### Mission
To make Georgian language learning accessible and free for everyone, breaking down language barriers for international residents, newcomers, and travelers in Georgia.

### Vision
To become the go-to platform for Georgian language learning, ensuring that language is never a barrier to connecting with Georgian culture and community.

### Core Principles
- **Free Forever**: All learning content remains free forever
- **No Barriers**: No premium accounts, ads, paywalls, or content restrictions
- **Cost Optimization**: Actively optimize infrastructure costs to delay monetization needs as long as possible
- **Operational Monetization Only**: Revenue only covers operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services)

## Business Strategy

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Non-Georgian speakers living in Georgia (international residents, students, workers)
- **Secondary**: People planning to move to Georgia
- **Tertiary**: Travelers wanting basic Georgian communication skills

### Value Proposition
**Free**, comprehensive Georgian language learning **without any content restrictions or premium barriers**, designed specifically for people living in or visiting Georgia. Users can learn Georgian in their **native language**. Includes **offline support** for learning anywhere, anytime.

### Revenue Model
- **Purpose**: Only to cover operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services)
- **Possible sources of income**: 
 Affiliate partnerships with learning resources (books, courses), learning platforms (online classes) or physical language schools
- **We will never go with**: Premium accounts, ads, paywalls, content restrictions, or marketing-focused monetization

### Competitive Advantage
- **Major language learning apps don't support Georgian well**
- **Existing Georgian language resources often operate on freemium models**
- Focus on **practical, real-world usage** for people in Georgia
- **Multi-language support** for native languages not typically supported
