### Target Market
- **Primary**: Non-Georgian speakers living in Georgia
- **Secondary**: People planning to move to Georgia
- **Tertiary**: Travelers wanting basic Georgian communication skills

### Value Proposition
**Free**, comprehensive Georgian language learning **without any content restrictions or premium barriers**, designed specifically for people living in or visiting Georgia; includes **offline support** for learning anywhere, anytime; no need to create an account or install anything to **try the learning experience in just a few clicks**

### Revenue Model
- **Purpose**: Only to cover operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services)
- **Possible sources of income**: Affiliate partnerships with learning resources (books, courses), learning platforms (online classes) or physical language schools; these activate only after free-tier limits are consistently exceeded (e.g., Supabase 50k MAU)
- **We will never go with**: Premium accounts, ads, paywalls, content restrictions, or marketing-focused monetization

### Competitive Advantage
- **Major language learning apps don't support Georgian well**
- **Existing Georgian language resources often operate on freemium models**
- Focus on **practical, real-world usage** for people in Georgia
- **Multi-language support** for native languages not typically supported
