### Game Client UX Decisions

**Core UX Principles**
- Avoid friction
- Start learning immediately after the landing CTA; no account creation required
- Treat English (`en`) native content pack as canonical; additional native languages inherit progress and gracefully fall back to English content when selected native content is not available

**Game-Specific Design Decisions**
- Immediate learning access without barriers
- Anonymous-first approach with optional account creation
- Progress continuity across language switches
- Offline-first experience design
