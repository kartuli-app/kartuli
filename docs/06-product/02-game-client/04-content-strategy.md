### Content Strategy
- Focus on high-utility language: alphabet mastery, greetings, politeness phrases, counting, and survival vocabulary that international residents need immediately
- Keep modules homogeneous (letters-only or words-only) while enabling short lessons so learners feel progress quickly
- Author content in structured JSON packs; reuse target-language media across native language packs to minimize duplication and cost
- Layer Georgian cultural context into imagery, example sentences, and audio so vocabulary reflects real Georgian life
- Support partial localization: native content packs can omit words not yet translated; UI falls back to English text while preserving items and progress
- Document editorial standards (tone, transliteration rules, audio quality) in the backoffice roadmap to sustain quality as packs scale beyond MVP
