### Gamification System

- Item mastery is binary: letters typically require 3–5 wins; words 5–8 wins; modules and lessons stay homogeneous (letters-only or words-only) so thresholds remain consistent
- Extra wins beyond the threshold do not change mastery status, and mastery cannot be lost
- Global levels emphasize early alphabet mastery before vocabulary expansion

| Level | Name         | Requirement            |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| 0     | Novice       | 0 items mastered      |
| 1     | Beginner     | 5 letters mastered    |
| 2     | Learner      | 10 letters mastered   |
| 3     | Intermediate | 15 letters mastered   |
| 4     | Explorer     | 5 words mastered      |
| 5     | Adept        | 10 words mastered     |
| 6     | Fluent       | 25 words mastered     |
| 7     | Expert       | 50 words mastered     |
| 8     | Master       | 100 words mastered    |
| 9     | Polyglot     | 200+ words mastered   |

- Modules and lessons inherit progress from their items; mastery completes once all contained items meet thresholds
- Optional points or visual rewards can layer on top without altering mastery or level logic
- Recommended mode surfaces the next lesson based on lowest mastery
