### MVP Content Pack Scope

- Letters: Full Georgian alphabet with target-script names, transliteration, audio, and usage hints. Native content packs supply native-language usage; missing content packs fall back to English
- Words: ~20 launch words covering greetings (`hello`, `goodbye`), politeness (`please`, `thank you`), essentials (`water`, `bathroom`, `bus`, `market`), numbers (1–3), and common verbs
- Modules: Distinct areas for alphabet and vocabulary; vocabulary modules are small (6–8 items) to reinforce mastery; future packs can expand counts gradually
- Lessons: 4–6 items, balanced by skill or theme, mixing letters or words only within their module type; recommended lessons are generated by the recommendation algorithm
- Native content packs: Additional native languages reuse the same `modules`/`lessons` item IDs. If a specific word lacks localization, the UI surfaces English text while keeping the item active so progress continuity persists
- Content pack manifest enumerates available native content packs per native language; client uses this to determine where fallbacks apply
