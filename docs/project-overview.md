# Project Overview

## Mission
To make Georgian language learning accessible and free for everyone, breaking down language barriers for international residents, newcomers, and travelers in Georgia

## Vision
To become the go-to platform for Georgian language learning, ensuring that language is never a barrier to connecting with Georgian culture and community

## Core principles
- **Free forever**: All learning content remains free forever
- **No barriers**: No need to create an account, No need to have internet, no premium accounts, no paywalls, no content restrictions
- **Cost optimization**: Optimize every infrastructure decision to support the maximum number of students while delaying monetization needs as long as possible
- **Operational monetization only**: Revenue only covers operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services), **never for profit**

## Target market
Non-Georgian speakers

## Value proposition
- **Free**, comprehensive Georgian language learning **without any content restrictions or premium barriers**
- Includes **offline support** for learning anywhere, anytime; 
- No need to create an account or install anything to **try the learning experience in just a few clicks**

## Revenue model
- **Purpose**: Only to cover operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services), **never profit**
- **Possible sources of income**: Affiliate partnerships with learning resources (books, courses), learning platforms (online classes) or physical language schools
    - **We would monetize only after provider free-tier limits are consistently exceeded**
- **We will never go with**: Premium accounts, ads, paywalls, content restrictions, or marketing-focused monetization

## Competitive advantage
- **Major language learning apps don't support Georgian well**
- Existing Georgian language learning apps are revenue driven, prioritizing profit vs student learning experience (freemium models, subscriptions, ads...)
- Multi-language support for native languages not typically supported
