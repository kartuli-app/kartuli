# Product Overview

## Mission

To make Georgian language learning accessible and free for everyone, breaking down language barriers for international residents, newcomers, and travelers in Georgia.

## Vision

To become the go-to platform for Georgian language learning, ensuring that language is never a barrier to connecting with Georgian culture and community.

## Core principles

- **Free forever**: All learning content remains free forever.
- **No barriers**: No need to create an account, no need to have internet, no premium accounts, no paywalls, no content restrictions.
- **Cost optimization**: Optimize every infrastructure decision to support the maximum number of students while delaying monetization needs as long as possible.
- **Operational monetization only**: Revenue only covers operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services), **never for profit**.

## Target market

Non-Georgian speakers.

## Value proposition

- **Free**, comprehensive Georgian language learning **without any content restrictions or premium barriers**.
- Includes **offline support** for learning anywhere, anytime.
- No need to create an account or install anything to **try the learning experience in just a few clicks**.

## Revenue model

- **Purpose**: Only to cover operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services), **never profit**.
- **Possible sources of income**: Affiliate partnerships with learning resources (books, courses), learning platforms (online classes) or physical language schools.
  - **We would monetize only after provider free-tier limits are consistently exceeded**.
- **We will never go with**: Premium accounts, ads, paywalls, content restrictions, or marketing-focused monetization.

## Competitive advantage

- **Major language learning apps don't support Georgian well**.
- Existing Georgian language learning apps are revenue driven, prioritizing profit vs student learning experience (freemium models, subscriptions, ads...).
- Multi-language support for native languages not typically supported.
