### To Discuss
- **Content tooling & localization pipeline**: Define the backoffice workflow for authoring packs, approving native content packs, and rolling out partial translations without regressions
- **Beta research loop**: Pick target communities, feedback tooling, and qualitative interview cadence for the MVP pilot
- **Marketing & comms playbook**: Align on brand identity, social handles, guerrilla tactics, and messaging guardrails consistent with the free-forever promise
- **Support operations**: Establish contact channels, help center tooling, SLAs, and escalation paths for user issues
- **Legal & compliance**: Finalize privacy/terms copy, analytics consent language, data export/deletion process, and affiliate disclosures
- **Accessibility & QA readiness**: Plan device/browser matrix, assistive tech audits, and performance budgets ahead of launch; testing, accessibility audits, and cross-device/browser coverage remain planned and will be scheduled ahead of the MVP beta
- **Reliability & incident response**: Set monitoring thresholds, on-call responsibilities, and rollback procedures for production incidents
