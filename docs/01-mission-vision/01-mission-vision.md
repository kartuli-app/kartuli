### Mission
To make Georgian language learning accessible and free for everyone, breaking down language barriers for international residents, newcomers, and travelers in Georgia

### Vision
To become the go-to platform for Georgian language learning, ensuring that language is never a barrier to connecting with Georgian culture and community

### Core Principles
- **Free Forever**: All learning content remains free forever
- **No Barriers**: No need to create an account, no premium accounts, ads, paywalls, or content restrictions
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize every infrastructure decision to support the maximum number of students while delaying monetization needs as long as possible
- **Operational Monetization Only**: Revenue only covers operational costs (servers, databases, authentication, email services)
